# Use the Jenkins base image as it is a public image that
# reliably sets up and uses a non-root user (uid 1000).
# https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/blob/master/Dockerfile-slim#L15
# Ideally we should use an unprivileged distroless user if
# https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless/issues/235 is implemented.
